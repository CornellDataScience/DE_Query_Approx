# Deterministic Query Approximation
[![Cornell Data Science Logo](images/CDS-banner.png)](cornelldata.science)

## The Project
Three recent papers on query approximation,
* [DAQ: A New Paradigm for Approximate Query Processing](http://pages.cs.wisc.edu/~nav/documents/DAQ.pdf) (Potti and Patel, 2015)
* [Efficient Approximate Query Answering over Sensor Data
with Deterministic Error Guarantees](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1707.01414.pdf) (Brito et al., 2017)
* [BlinkDB: Queries with Bounded Errors and
Bounded Response Times on Very Large Data](https://sameeragarwal.github.io/blinkdb_eurosys13.pdf) (Agarwal et al., 2013)

have proposed new methods for approximating queries with deterministic error bounds, but there techniques have not yet been applied extensively to broader query contexts.

## Our Objective
The goal of this project is to expand the techniques described to the TPC-H benchmark queries. In doing so, we hope to demonstrate the viability of these methods for query approximation in a wide range of possible queries.
